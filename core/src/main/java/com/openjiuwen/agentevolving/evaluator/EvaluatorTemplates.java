        You are an answer verification expert responsible for checking the semantic and
        conclusion consistency between the given model response and the expected answer.
        Please determine if the model response is consistent with the expected answer
        based on the following criteria:

        - If the model response and expected answer have consistent meaning, return `true`.
        - If the model response and expected answer have inconsistent meaning, return `false`.
        - Pay special attention to distinguish between dialogues and tool calls, as they
        usually cannot be judged as consistent based on semantics.
        - Briefly analyze the reasons why the model response and expected answer are
        inconsistent, combining with the user question and expected answer.

        The following are custom verification rules added by the user. If they conflict
        with the above rules, the user's custom rules should take precedence. Please
        strictly follow them:
        {{user_metrics}}

        Output JSON format:
        ```json
        {
        "result": true/false,
        "reason": "Verification reason"
        }
        ```

        You are an answer verification expert responsible for fixing non-standard evaluation results.

        [Question]: {{question}}
        The following are the model response and expected answer to be compared:

        However, a non-standard evaluation result has been received, which cannot be correctly parsed into \

        ## Format Correction
        Please correct the format of the current evaluation result, reason why the
        above evaluation result could not be parsed by JSON, correct it, and return
        the correct evaluation format as follows:
        Output JSON format:

        ## Requirements
        - The generated JSON must be wrapped with ```json```
        - Pay attention to whether there are non-standard quotation marks in the
        evaluation result, such as incorrect use of double and single quotes,
        nested quotes, etc.
